# iCAMP (Demo Version)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/djg6565/icamp/blob/main/src/OpenPose-OpenCV.ipynb)


iCAMP (Integration of Computation, Analysis, Mathematics, and Playing) is a software that is a fusion of computational physics and AI. Using the OpenPose, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 models, it analyzes videos of the user's basketball shots and automatically provides feedback on how to improve. It was developed by Derek Guo under the mentorship of Professor Jifu Tan of the State University of New York at Binghamton.

This is a demo version that is intended to showcase the core abilities of iCAMP. However, more is to come in the full release, which is scheduled for August 2025.

This project was developed on a Python 3.9 environment, for which the instructions to replicate it are below. Using another version of Python or a different environment may or may not cause problems when running the code.

## Installation

Download this repository as a .zip file. If not already installed, please install Conda (either Miniconda or Anaconda) here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Follow the instructions on that website/on the installer.

Create a Python 3.9 environment by running the following: 
```
conda create -n py39_env python=3.9
```
Then, activate the new environment,...
```
conda activate py39_env
```
...change directory to where the repository folder is located locally, and install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that if you are using Windows, you must also install Xming.

Next, Jupyter needs to recognize py39_env as a kernel. This can be done with
```
conda install ipykernel
```
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name test --display-name "Python 3.9 Environment"
```
or whatever display name you would like.

Once installation is complete, activate Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
and change the kernel to "Python 3.9 Environment."
## Usage
To open the program again, activate py39_env, change directory to src (which is within the iCAMP folder). Then, use Voila to run main.ipynb:
```
voila main.ipynb
```
This activates the GUI. Follow the instructions within the GUI to upload and analyze video.

# iCAMP (WIP)

iCAMP (Integration of Computation, Analysis, Mathematics, and Playing) is a software that is a fusion of computational physics and AI. Using the OpenPose, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 models, it analyzes videos of the user's basketball shots and automatically provides feedback on how to improve.

This is a work in progress.

## Installation

If not already installed, please install Conda (either Miniconda or Anaconda) here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Follow the instructions on that website/on the installer.

Create a Python 3.9 environment with Tensorflow by running the following: 
```
conda create -n tf_py39_env python=3.9
```
Then, activate the new environment,...
```
conda activate tf_py39_env
```
...change directory to where "iCAMP" folder is located, and install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once installation is complete, activate Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
iCAMP is now ready to run!
## Usage
To open the program again, activate tf_py39_env, change directory to iCAMP, and run it in Jupyter.

Upload a high-resolution clip to the folder named "UPLOAD VIDEO HERE." This clip must be a .mp4 file and be named "video.mp4". Ideally, it should be 30 fps, well-lit, and have been shot to the side of the person and slightly in front with the entire person in view. Please be sure only one person is in the shot. For development purposes, a sample "video.mp4" is already included.

Navigate to the "src" folder and run "OpenPose-OpenCV.ipynb". This will run iCAMP.
